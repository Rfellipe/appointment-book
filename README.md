# Appointment Book
This is an appointment book or a diary that I created along of my course 

## Getting started
After cloning the repo, you need a MongoDB database to use this repository, I was taught to use the cloud cluster of Mongo so I suggest you do the same then just create a ".env" file with 

```
CONNECTIONSTRING= connection string provided in the mongo cloud
```

afeter that run this three commands on the terminal

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ npm run dev
```

the first one is to install all the packages used in this project, the second is to run nodemon for you to access the site then the last one is for you to start the webpack

## Usage
When accessing the project on your browser this is all you can do:

* Create an account
* Log In to an account
* Create a contact 
* Read a contact
* Update a contact
* Delete a contact
